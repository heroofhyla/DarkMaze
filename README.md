# DarkMaze
This game (name not yet decided) is a simple dungeon/maze exploration game, in the dark. People who've looked at it have variously described it as seeming like Pac-Man or the original Gauntlet games.

At this point, the game is simple, and you just explore randomly generated mazes, trying to collect coins and avoid enemies, who will chase you if they see you. The future of the game is very nebulous at the moment, and I have a lot of ideas about what I might want to implement. Please note that at this point I'm still ripping out and moving or replacing big chunks of code whenever I get the inspiration.

Also, some of my commits are listed as being by Aezart, rather than by heroofhyla. That's due to me not remembering to set my email address in Eclipse's team settings on my desktop. It should be fixed for updates from today on.
